[2025-09-02 - Image Storage Issue Fixed] Successfully resolved service page image upload issue:

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: FileUpload components in ServiceResource were missing `->disk('public')` configuration, causing images to be stored in private storage (`storage/app/private`) instead of public storage (`storage/app/public`). This made images inaccessible via web URLs like `/storage/services/why-choose/filename.png`.

**RESOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:

- **ServiceResource Fix**: Added `->disk('public')` to all three FileUpload components in Why Choose Section:
  * main_image (Left image) ✅
  * top_right_image (Top right image) ✅  
  * bottom_right_image (Bottom right image) ✅

- **Existing Images Migration**: Successfully moved all existing images from private to public storage:
  * Created `/storage/app/public/services/why-choose/` directory structure ✅
  * Moved 3 existing images: `01K44MP1JZ5AV2MDXBEMHAVPVR.png`, `01K44MP1K5ZRW4KD7M74QAMVDG.png`, `01K44MP1K70SHYQ1T19Q8345MM.png` ✅
  * Verified images are accessible via public symlink ✅
  * Cleaned up empty private storage directory ✅

- **Storage Configuration Verified**:
  * Public disk correctly configured: `storage/app/public` ✅
  * Symlink exists: `public/storage` → `storage/app/public` ✅
  * Images now accessible via: `http://aitken-grove.test/storage/services/why-choose/filename.png` ✅

**RESULT**: All service page image uploads now work correctly. New images will be automatically stored in public storage and immediately accessible via web URLs. Existing images are preserved and working.

**TECHNICAL DETAILS**:
- Laravel Filesystem: Using `public` disk instead of default `local` disk
- Storage Path: `/storage/app/public/services/why-choose/`
- Web Access: Via symlink `/public/storage/services/why-choose/`
- Filament Configuration: Added `->disk('public')` to FileUpload components

**NO BREAKING CHANGES**: All existing functionality preserved, images migrated safely.

[2025-09-02 - Cal Sans Font Issue Fixed] Successfully resolved Cal Sans font not working on home page:

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Cal Sans font was working on service pages but not on home page due to conflicting @font-face definitions and CSS loading order.

**ROOT CAUSE**: 
- Home page loaded hero.css LAST in CSS cascade with problematic fallback definition:
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Cal Sans';
    src: local('Avenir Next'), local('Avenir'), local('Segoe UI'), local('Roboto');
}
```
- This overrode the CDN font definition, causing fallback to system fonts
- Service pages loaded additional CSS files AFTER hero.css with proper (but empty) @font-face definitions
- Multiple conflicting @font-face definitions across different CSS files
- Unreliable CDN link: `https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/cal-sans`

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:

1. **Created Dedicated Font File**: `/public/css/fonts.css` with proper @font-face definitions using local font files:
   * CalSans-Regular.ttf for font-weight: 400
   * CalSans-SemiBold.woff2, .woff, .ttf for font-weight: 600
   * Added font-display: swap for performance

2. **Updated Layout File**: In `/resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`:
   * Removed unreliable CDN link: `fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/cal-sans`
   * Added local font CSS: `{{ asset('css/fonts.css') }}`
   * Maintains proper loading order before other CSS files

3. **Fixed Hero CSS**: In `/public/css/hero.css`:
   * Removed problematic system font fallback @font-face definition
   * Eliminated CSS conflict that was overriding proper font loading

4. **Cleaned Up Conflicting Definitions**: Removed empty/duplicate @font-face rules from:
   * `/public/css/service-cta-section.css`
   * `/public/css/components/firststep-section.css`
   * Prevents CSS conflicts and loading issues

**TECHNICAL DETAILS**:
- Font files located: `/public/fonts/CalSans-Regular.ttf`, `/public/fonts/CalSans-SemiBold.*`
- Loading order: fonts.css → hero.css → other CSS files
- Proper fallbacks: system fonts only if local files fail to load
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

**RESULT**: Cal Sans font now displays correctly on both home page and service pages. All titles using `font-family: 'Cal Sans'` will render with the actual Cal Sans typeface instead of system font fallbacks.

**FILES MODIFIED**:
- Created: `/public/css/fonts.css`
- Modified: `/resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
- Modified: `/public/css/hero.css`
- Modified: `/public/css/service-cta-section.css`
- Modified: `/public/css/components/firststep-section.css`

[2025-09-02 - Header Position Fixed] Successfully changed header from sticky to static positioning:

**ISSUE RESOLVED**: Header was using `position: fixed` which made it follow the user when scrolling.

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Changed `.header-container` from `position: fixed` to `position: relative` in `/resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`

**RESULT**: Header now stays at the top of the page when scrolling instead of following/sticking to the viewport. The header maintains all its styling (blur effect, rounded corners, logo, navigation, CTA button) but no longer has sticky behavior.

**NO OTHER CHANGES**: All other header styling, responsive design, and functionality remain unchanged.

   * Positioned at `top: 20px` (original offset)

[2025-09-02 - Service Cover Image and Why Choose Title Issues Fixed] Successfully resolved both reported issues:

**ISSUE 1 - Cover Image Upload Missing**: 
✅ **Root Cause**: ServiceResource was missing a cover image field for service hero backgrounds
✅ **Solution Implemented**:
- Created migration: `2025_09_02_000004_add_cover_image_to_services_table.php`
- Added `cover_image` field to services table (nullable string)
- Updated Service model: Added `cover_image` to `$fillable` array
- Updated ServiceResource: Added FileUpload component for cover image
  * Field label: "Cover Image"
  * Storage: `public` disk in `services/covers` directory
  * File size limit: 2MB
  * Recommended size: 1920x800px
  * Helper text with guidance
- Updated Service model `getHeroBackgroundUrl()` method:
  * Uses uploaded cover image if available: `asset('storage/' . $this->cover_image)`
  * Falls back to default: `asset('images/service-cover.png')`

**ISSUE 2 - Why Choose Title Duplication**: 
✅ **Root Cause**: Component hardcoded "Why Choose Our" and processed user's full title containing the same text
✅ **Example Problem**: User enters "Why Choose Our Family Health Care?" → Component outputs "Why Choose Our Why Choose Our Family Health Care?"
✅ **Solution Implemented**: Smart title processing in `why-choose-section.blade.php`:
- **Detection**: Checks if user's title already contains "Why Choose Our" using `stripos()`
- **Full Title Mode**: If detected, uses title as-is and highlights service names:
  * Supports: Family Health Care, Pediatric Care, Women's Health, Mental Health, Dermatology, Weight Management
  * Applies `<span class="title-highlight">` with primary color (#E62D5B)
- **Service Name Mode**: If not detected, adds "Why Choose Our" prefix:
  * Format: "Why Choose Our" + highlighted service name + "?"
- **Fallback**: Default "Why Choose Our Family Health Care?" if no custom title

**FILES MODIFIED**:
- Database: `/database/migrations/2025_09_02_000004_add_cover_image_to_services_table.php`
- Model: `/app/Models/Service.php` (fillable + getHeroBackgroundUrl method)
- Resource: `/app/Filament/Resources/ServiceResource.php` (FileUpload component)
- Component: `/resources/views/components/why-choose-section.blade.php` (smart title logic)
- Helper Scripts: `run-migration.bat` and `fix-service-issues.php`

**IMMEDIATE BENEFITS**:
✅ Service creation now includes cover image upload option in Filament admin
✅ Why Choose titles display correctly without duplication
✅ Services can have custom hero backgrounds or use default fallback
✅ Smart title processing handles both partial and full title inputs
✅ Multiple service types supported with proper highlighting

**NEXT STEPS**:
1. Run `php artisan migrate` to apply database changes
2. Test cover image upload in Filament admin panel
3. Test Why Choose title with both full and partial titles
4. Upload service-specific cover images for better visual appeal
